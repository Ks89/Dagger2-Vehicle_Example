## Dagger 2 Example

A small example that I'm improving while studying Dagger 2... Work in progress... :)

I represented a Vehicle as a combination of SprungMass (engine, tank and so on) and UnprungMass (wheels, suspensions and so on).

At the moment, I implemented only the first one. (partially because I'll add also HybridEngine in the future)

In this example there are many commented classes. Please ignore them! I'll push really implemented classes in the future.
